# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering
This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their behavior and characteristics to uncover meaningful patterns and enable targeted marketing strategies.

âœ… Key Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted a thorough EDA to understand the underlying trends, distributions, and relationships in the dataset. This helped identify key features for clustering.

Clustering Models Applied

K-Means Clustering: Used to segment customers into distinct groups based on similarities in spending behavior and other features. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.

Hierarchical Clustering: Applied to compare results with K-Means and visualize the hierarchical relationships among customers using dendrograms.

ðŸ“ˆ Outcome:
Successfully segmented customers into meaningful clusters, which can help businesses personalize services, optimize marketing strategies, and improve customer retention.
